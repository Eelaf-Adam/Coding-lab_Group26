## 🏥💡 Automated Log Management System for Healthcare Monitoring 
### A. About the project:
This project aims to provide an automated log management system, designed to enhance patient care and the operations in hospitals. It supports healthcare environments with an efficient process flow.

### B. Project objective:
By developing this project the following objectives will be acheived:

1. Collects real-time patient health metrics and resource usage data

2. Provides controlled log archiving with user selection

3. Generates analytical reports with device statistics and temporal patterns

<br></br>
## 🚀 Project Status
This project is fully developed and contains the following features that users can interact with:

i. Interactive Archive Script.

ii. Intelligent Analysis Script.

iii. Report Overview System.

 ## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

1. Clone the project repository locally using your terminal.
```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Eelaf-Adam/Coding-lab_Group26.git
```
```sh
   cd Coding-lab_Group26
   cd Hospital_mgt_system
```

2. Ensure the necessary tools are avaialble
```sh
   -Python 3
   -Bash for scripts
   -Linux-based system or environment (GitBash, Ubuntu, WSL)
```

3. Make the scripts excutable

<br></br>

1. Access the hospital directory and run the script of your choice.

2. The scripts present numbered menus and prompt the user to enter their selection of choice.
   
4. The archive script retrieves data from the active logs directory and accesses the file corresponding to the option choosen in the menu.
   
6. Upon retrieving the data, it stores the log file information in a file corresponding to the option choosen in the menu.
   
8. The analysis script provides a report overview of the log file of choice.
   
10. The report overview contains number of devices in the log, first time stamp entry,and last time stamp entry.
